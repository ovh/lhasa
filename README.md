# Lhasa

Urba planning for microservices.

List and map applications of your microservices information system and how they interact. Track your business 
processes and domains, then gamify the continuous enhancement of your system.

[![goreportcard](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ovh/lhasa)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ovh/lhasa)

This project is at pre-alpha state and under active development.

## Features

### Application catalog

Applications of your information system are grouped in *business domains*.
Meta data about each application version should be stored directly in the codebase (see: manifest files) and are
collected to be presented in the user interface.

### Deployment tracking

Each time you deploy a release on a given environment you can notify *Lhasa* API and track which version is available on
each environment.

## Build and run project

### Technical overview

This project is currently at very early stage and under active development. It is mainly written in golang and in angular5.

### Build project

#### Requirements

* Git
* [Go installation](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) (`GOROOT` and `GOPATH` correctly set)
* GNU Make
* [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) - Go dependency management tool
* [Angular 5 CLI](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) - Management CLI for angular 5

#### Steps

Go get the project, then run the default Makefile target:

```
go get github.com/ovh/lhasa/api/cmd/appcatalog
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ovh/lhasa
make
```

### Run project

#### Requirements

* PostgreSQL 9.4 or later

##### Steps
 
###### Start requirements

If you don't have a postgres instance, you can start one locally using [docker-compose]:

```
$ PORT=100 docker-compose up # $PORT is appended with '32' as listening port. "10032" in this example.
```

[docker-compose]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

###### Configuration file

Copy `config.json.dist` as `config.json` and edit the latest to match your database configuration:

```json
{
    "appcatalog-db": {
        "writers": [
            {
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 10032,
                "sslmode": "disable"
            }
        ],
        "database": "postgres",
        "user": "postgres",
        "password": "appcatalog",
        "type": "postgresql"
    }
}
```

###### Start Lhasa

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ovh/lhasa
APPCATALOG_AUTO_MIGRATE=1 make run
```

Lhasa will start and listen on port `8081`.

Note that `APPCATALOG_AUTO_MIGRATE=1` will perform database schema migrations/creations automatically.

###### Load the sample dataset (optional)

Optionally, you can load the sample dataset to immediately start playing:

```
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081/api ./samples/mycompany.sh
```
